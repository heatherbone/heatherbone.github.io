         My research focuses on the economics of crime, with a particular focus on illicit drug markets. I am particularly interested in how criminalization and enforcement effects the decisions of criminal actors and the resulting consequences for security and public health. 
         
         Doing so is challenging because of the industry's illicit nature: Criminal enterprises are not tracked in administrative data and often wish to keep their actions hidden, fearing prosecution.  In the spirit of forensic economics, my work leverages big data, machine learning, and geographic information systems to observe the actions of these organizations.
